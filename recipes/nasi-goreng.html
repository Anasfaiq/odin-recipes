        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Fried rice, or <i>nasi goreng</i>, is one of Indonesia’s most famous dishes, loved for its rich flavor and simplicity. It’s made by stir-frying cooked rice with garlic, shallots, chili, soy sauce, and a mix of ingredients like egg, chicken, shrimp, or vegetables. What makes Indonesian fried rice special is its smoky aroma, often achieved by cooking it on high heat in a wok. It’s commonly served with toppings like fried egg, crackers (<i>kerupuk</i>), and sliced cucumber or tomato on the side. More than just a quick meal, <i>nasi goreng</i> represents Indonesia’s creativity in turning simple leftovers into something delicious and comforting.
